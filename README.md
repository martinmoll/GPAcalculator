# GPA calculator 4.0 scale

### Functionality

The calculator allows for adding and removing classes by specifying the class id of the class to be added, or specifying the name for the class to be removed(not case sensitive).

Upon clicking the `calculate GPA` button, both GPA and average grade(letter form) will be dislayed. Where the average letter grade rounds the gpa to the closest whole number, and thereafter converts it to a letter grade. Naturally, this is more accurate when the GPA is closer to a whole number, and will paint a less accurate pictures closer to .5 values --> for example: GPA: 2.5 will provide an average letter grade of B due to rounding.
